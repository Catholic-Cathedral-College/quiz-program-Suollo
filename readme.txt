WELCOME TO ELI'S QUIZ GAME
there are two gamemodes you may choose
gamemode 1 : Set question mode (Rosa)
put in an amount of questions you want to be asked and answer from that amount (this would need to be extended with more questions but yeah)

gamemode 2 : Set Score mode (Hallie)
put in a score goal to work to and answer questions till you reach that score (this would also benefit from more questions)

I made the code for questions fairly simple to the point where you only need to ctr-c/v and change a few things to add questions
